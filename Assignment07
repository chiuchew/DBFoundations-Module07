Functions

Intro
This paper will walk through when to use a SQL User Defined Function (UDF) and the differences and similarities between the various UDFs: Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions.  
When To Use SQL UDF
A UDF accepts parameters and returns the result as an output. UDFs are used in programming SQL code and it allows writing up queries fast. 
Differences & Similarities Between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions
Scalar user-defined functions return a single value. They will always contain a RETURNS clause in it. Multi-Statement Functions syntax is like the scalar user-defined function but instead provides multi-values as the output. Inline table values functions are performance optimized functions. They do not contain table definitions. Instead, the subquery within the inline table value function is a single statement, therefore, it does not provide any performance issues when we use it batches or in loops.
Summary
A SQL UDF has three different types of functions: scalar, inline and multi-statement functions. For an optimal performance, it is best to use the inline function because an inline table-valued function returns a variable of data type table whose value is derived from a single SELECT statement. There is no need to specify the table variable name because the structure of the returned value is generated from the columns that compose the SELECT statement.
